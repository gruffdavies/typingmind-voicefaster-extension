# Voice Faster Extension and Plugin For TypingMind

Purpose:

# Live Versions

The repo uses GitHub Pages to publish the code in a way that makes it visible publically.

## IMPORTANT

- Live Extensions Are Injected Into The Browser and run immediately.
- Use with caution!

## Live URIs

URIs for live versions of the extension take the form:

`https://gruffdavies.github.io/typingmind-voicefaster-extension/live/voicefaster-extension-{SEMVER}.js`


1. More than one version of the extension can be live at the same time.
2. The version number is the semantic version of the extension.
3. The version number in the URI should be the same as the version number in the code (but mistakes happen, so this is not guaranteed).
4. A copy of the plugin code is in comments in the extension code along with its version.
5. That version is tested to work with the extension. Later versions may not work.

## Test Versions

NB: Test versions are also visible publically and can be used to test versions of the extension.
